Thanks all so far, and this yes is super weird, spoke with the namecheap and they said:
"Thank you for choosing our services! It can be due to the nc.me program (the domain name was added to the GitHub pages). Unfortunately, we do not have access to the GitHub side to see why the domain name is still displayed there.
You can say that the domain name globalconnect.me is not connected to the GitHub Pages on the side of your DNS provider."
Also same issue happened to other person in my bootcamp, might be more victims that haven't yet tried using github pages :dog-on-fire:

@Manel
 Be sure to be respectful of all parties here and contact the author's company about his inaptitude at following (very) basic community rules, not being able to take a step back and see the overall extend of his actions as well as having the emotional maturity of a toddler when being confronted with it.
Just saying.

In these occurrences, addressing both parties is usually interesting to get to the bottom of things.

@Manel
 as stated a couple of times now, I’m trying to understand your position. What do you see that we don’t? I’m referring to this post author that went against community rules, notifying 20k something people I believe? When confronted, nothing good came from it as I put in my previous message. Bullying is indeed not acceptable, and how would you proceed in these instances? How can we self regulate as a community for such events?
I reached out twice now trying to understand, I get it if you don’t want to answer  (edited) 
12:11
As for the general bullying from ex-TAs, while I’m not aware of such situations, it sucks and I’m sorry it happened and that some people fell into this, so do no hesitate to report such occurrences to the wagon who’s still the organisation responsible for this space that, usually, goes above and beyond to help students and others.

You're declaring defamation on something said about the author of the thread, not you. It seemed a genuine question to ask if you understand what defamation is.
Following the escallation, i stated that indeed i think you are perhaps misguided.
You speak of my case. What i'm trying to say, but somehow seem to be failing, is that there is no case. I would call this reaching.
Agree to disagree, perhaps.

That being said, to the OP:
I sincerely hope the jokes were not that bad, was not meant to be a pile on (I can't see the pile on but who am I to judge how anyone felt)
I do hope you understand how people might be grumpy about being pinged for something in violation of the rules. (And why those rules where put in place, what if everyone pinged 26k people for every question).
I think people here took exception at you not even acknowledging that you had pinged everyone, and starting to get aggressive when someone called you out on it. Maybe just a:
'Sorry, didn't know I wasn't meant to, wont do again, thanks for the help' could have avoided quite a lot of this.
But then again, who am I to judge.
yall have a good day

I don't think I made anyone cry today, but if I did, I'm truly sorry and I apologize. I believe nothing in my communication could have triggered that, but if it did happen solely because of what I said, please be assured that I feel sorry about that person (and as you mentioned, English is not my native language either)

What’s funny is that most of them are ex-TAs or batch managers, claiming that the Slack channels have rules and mourning about notifications — actually thinking that’s a valid excuse to bully others and throw words around. It’s such a low bar. But then again, it’s hard to expect high standards from people who rely on performative authority instead of demonstrating real integrity or professionalism.

Thank you for the support, 
@Manel
, 
@Paul Foma
 , and the others who genuinely tried to help me with my GitHub issue.
Remember, we’ve all been beginners and got stuck at some point. Sometimes we don’t phrase things perfectly or ask the right questions. I understood my mistake, but since some of you joked around about the tagging, I moved on. When I was sending my final thank-you message, I was suddenly being confronted — even though others had also tagged everyone.
Also, this is an educational platform. Jokes between friends are fine in the right context, but this isn’t the place. Shockingly, some of you work as teachers — people who are supposed to create a safe environment for young adults and help correct misbehaviour. What I witnessed instead was immaturity at its finest, with no regard for others. If this is how you act publicly, I can only imagine how you treat people outside the chat.
To be honest, I felt really uncomfortable. No one else spoke up, and it felt like the bullying had become normalised on this platform. That shouldn't be okay.

And if you were truly friends, or even just decent peers,  you would’ve tried to spare each other the embarrassment. But instead, you let it continue, piling on and making it worse. No one paused to reflect or step in. It was disappointing to watch, and it said a lot about the dynamic here.

Well I went again through the messages and seen that 
@gkosmo
 deleted some of his messages (worse move ever) because obviously we had made screenshots … about everything even the reaction (very shocked to see that TAs were mocking us with emoticons).
@Pablo Curell Mompo
 also confessed that 
@gkosmo
 did use extensively the tag channel and they were joking about it … but surprisingly bullied you for it when you apologized ! (They were too happy to joke around by bullying us to accept that apology I guess).
Thanks to that we ve been able to dive more about le wagon … and thanks to these bullying TAs and ex TAs we found out many confessions online about such behavior.
They haven’t even apologized to you once ….. they haven’t also apologized to me ! (Except the usual - I did nothing wrong but if I did- even if I haven’t I apologize- I mean please LOOOOOL).
Now the real question is how a student is supposed to know that channels have rules ? And where to read them ? And why they have the possibility to tag the channel ? Why 
@gkosmo
 could do it in the past and joke about it but is now bullying people about it ???
Non sense
Again gentlemen …. You didn’t want to apologized and stop before it went out of hand ! Nobody checked on me after my seizure.
Hope you are happy with the outcomes 
@Killian Dectot
 hope you still find this very very entertaining 
@Niko
 
@Joenn
 literally asked to be sued :) well you re signed up for it (hope you are happy)
Maybe he thought I was lying or playing around but by seeing my partner linkdin they understood that …. They are in trouble  (edited)

To those who jumped in just for the ride, take a moment and think. You weren’t helping, you were embarrassing yourselves. And for what? A quick laugh? A moment of fitting in? Whatever you say, however casually you treat others, it sticks with you. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but the guilt, the imprint of your actions — that doesn’t just vanish. One day you might look back and realise the part you played, and it won't sit as lightly as it did in the moment.

Wants and deeds are not always aligned.
Accusations and CAPS lock messages are antagonising and if what she wanted was for the conversation was to deescalate it she should have preferred understanding and compromise rather than that.
It's not enough to have good intentions (which you agree to because you think we were wrong in pointing out your wrongful usage of the @channel despite us having good intentions of teaching you about netiquette) and sometimes clumsily meddling into other people affairs only worsen the situation which happened this time.
We're not blaming her for defending you. I'm blaming her for being insufferable.
And I'm blaming you for ignoring the code of conduct stated in the  #help channel, showing no sign of remorse and on the contrary claiming your entitlement to bypass such rules.
If you don't agree with my opinion of you you are free to ignore my messages and move on. (edited)

Honestly, just saying “oh ok, didn’t know” and removing the @ channel would have been totally enough to move on without all this escalation. I get that everyone reacts differently, but calling this bullying feels like a stretch. A lot of us made the same mistake in the past and were met with a bit of playful teasing. No one took it personally. It’s a bit surprising how quickly things escalated emotionally instead of just acknowledging a small slip-up and moving forward. Criticism, especially when lighthearted, isn’t an attack. No need to turn it into a courtroom drama. (edited)

Again, I didn't say you have to apologize to me, just that you didn't apologize either for your behaviour.
That behaviour being not recognising you made a mistake by tagging 25k person for your problem and pretending you were entitled to ping all those people because LeWagon is responsible for your issue.
Rather than acknowledging that mistake you became snarky and started trolling people saying if they don't want to be disturbed they're responsible for turning their notification off and such.
There was other messages where you were even a bit rude but because you deleted those anything I'd say would be hearsay so I'm not going to bother


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:13 PM
It's funny how you want an apology, and when I make one, you choose that it is not one... I honestly don't know how to give you what you want.
I, again, assure you that it was a sincere apology (you can reread it if you want and challenge every word in it), and I have a hard time understanding why you don't want to acknowledge it (you are free to accept it or not)

 you think I’m joking :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
You think it comes overnight ?
You’ll have it don’t worry
And yes you are a RACIST
@Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
 please accept the request of my fiancé he’s going to send some interesting stuff  :)
 


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 2:29 PM
Do emails take time to be delivered now ?


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:29 PM
Yes 
@Lukasz Krzizek
, you accused everyone of breaking YOUR GitHub...
I find this behavior childish, and it reminded me of this picture. I did not insult anyone, whether you like it or not...
I only said I was impressed by your ability to blame other people, which by the very definition of what you have written, is what happened.


Manel
  Saturday at 2:30 PM
@Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
 you didn’t recognize it was bullying
If you do I swear to drop charges for you (please share my fiancé legal actions to 
@Joenn
, once you accepted his request )
Plus your empty apology was really bad


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:30 PM
@Manel
 I did mention that I accepted it already and I gave you all my details


Manel
  Saturday at 2:31 PM
@Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
 so you acknowledge it was a bullying case ?
Thank you that’s all I wanted
Have a good day


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 2:31 PM
Just because you have your own definition for certain words doesn’t mean that facts are as you said Manel :face_with_rolling_eyes:
You call us bullies, I call you a bully. Everyone’s a bully :exploding_head:


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:32 PM
I accepted the LinkedIn connection, nothing more nothing less


Manel
  Saturday at 2:32 PM
@Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
 no you didn’t accept my fiancé request on linkdin


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:32 PM
What's his name? I have a lot of requests


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 2:33 PM
@Manel
 Laurent has to give you proofs of him accepting the request but you won’t give proofs of my racist behaviour.
Are you familiar with the term “double standards” ?


Manel
  Saturday at 2:34 PM
Saying you accepting it and now reversing your sayings :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: 
More lies
I shared his name yesterday

This is the proof you asked me

The "1er" means first degree connection
2:35
Meaning we are connected
2:36
I don't know how else to prove it to you
2:36
(Not that I have to, but again I'm doing things in good faith)


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 2:36 PM
You literally share his name over and over again and are mad for the screenshot ? :smile:


Manel
  Saturday at 2:36 PM
Do you know what a dm is for ?

You mentioned his name and his whole resume on this thread...

Manel
  Saturday at 2:37 PM
Did I share his face ?


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:37 PM
How was I supposed to know that the public information you gave was supposed to stay private


Manel
  Saturday at 2:37 PM
Between doing a research and exposing someone s face directly on a public place is very different


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:37 PM
Well you should have asked me for the proof in DM
2:37
I was only complying to your request


Manel
  Saturday at 2:39 PM
Well you can at least delete his face don’t you think? (edited) 


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:39 PM
I don't want to be accused of deleting proofs, I have not and will not start deleting messages


Manel
  Saturday at 2:42 PM
Trying to play smart ass …..
Please ask your friend ChatGPT to see what laws you’re breaking by not complying to a request from a personal figure :)


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:42 PM
No, this time you prove it


Manel
  Saturday at 2:42 PM
I mean you keep getting yourself in deep pbs :face_with_peeking_eye:
How do you do that ?
2:42
I mean keep it if you want
That will be another point to attack you


Laurent MICHEL-AMADRY
  Saturday at 2:42 PM
Can we act like grownups and let our lawyers decide this mess?

Sit and wait


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 4:15 PM
Ok sorry I was out for a bit.
Manel where were we ? Are you ready to back down yet and show some regret for your behaviour or you wanna keep going ?
I'm really curious about what made you so insecure that you feel the need to act this way but sadly these traumas that you might or might not have are not going to solve themselves by being aggressive toward strangers.
If you can't stand us then ignore us and move on. I know it's difficult because I have trouble letting go too but at the same time you keep saying you're putting your health at risk by keeping this conversation so you should accept that you can't have it your way this time


Manel
  Saturday at 6:29 PM
@Joenn
 stop :hand:
This message you posted is full of lies and weird statement but we all understood you re a psycho, narcissist pervert.

We don’t want to talk with a racist
Now your bullying, attacks and the fact you love targeting me makes sense
You are a racist (the posts and likes you gave on social media proves it !)

Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 6:35 PM
Then please do yourself a service and talk to me again nor to any other person offending you.
You keep saying you don't want to talk to me and yet you keep replying. Honestly I'm starting to wonder if you really mean what you're saying or if your aggressively might be hiding a warmer feeling towards me :flushed:
Honestly I think you're pretty cute too, maybe we could stop bickering in public and move to DMs ? What do you think ?


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 6:43 PM
Maybe that's why you decided to send me a mail instead of asking your boyfriend to add me on Linkedin like the other ? You probably don't want him to know about us :face_with_peeking_eye:


gkosmo
:rick:  Saturday at 6:43 PM
Can we keep all the messages related to the thread in this thread and not pin or make them public and start other threads :pray:
Just to be respectful of the others who need help ( and also I guess it will be easier on the lawyers)

Lukasz is there someone in this thread you have special feelings for too ? :relaxed:
Everything is becoming clear to me now, this makes so much sense.
What does the saying say ? "Tough love" You two must really like that special person then. This is becoming so wholesome :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:

Hi everyone,
As a concerned community member and alumni I just wanted to say this:
Whatever has happened here, and not passing any judgement to any single person, please consider community guidelines, we all have signed a contract and possibly several of you are in breach of that with the lengths you are going.
If you don't want to possibly get kicked out of this community and lose access to the content, I would suggest, whoever you might be, stop before it's too late, no matter how right you think you might be.
Sending this with the hopes of everyone putting on the brakes and not getting anyone else involved in this situation :pray::skin-tone-2:

 Sorry, but this isn't the right place to seek #help for your mental health issues. Just so you know, there are places specifically designed to support people in these situations. I'm more than happy to guide you through the process and #help you seek support extensively :saluting_face: p.s. all the best

So did you and yet here we are.
Just as if none of us is able to let go of the other.
Don't you think it's strange how much we've felt that compulsion to talk to each other for 2 days now ?


Lukasz Krzizek
  Saturday at 7:18 PM
Talking to you feels like talking to a wall, and I hope you get better, because there's obviously something not right with you.

@Francisco
 will the people who insulted and bullied us be banned from here ?
I don’t think it is normal to let them go like that
Even though I’m still going with legal actions
Because what happened here was not okay
8:14
Funny how the aggressors reacted to Francisco post but he clearly said “we all have signed a contract and possibly several of you are in breach of that …”
And that was about the TAs that are bullying us
Still no apologies  …..
From the aggressors
8:16
@Joenn
 you kept bullying us … and we kept defending our basic rights
Your urge to keep going on with the bullying is not something we understand nor identify with
But again wait and see :male-judge:


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 8:16 PM
I think he meant the community guideline you have to approve when joining LeWagon, not an employment contract.
Which you and I signed too despite not being teachers at LeWagon (edited) 


Manel
  Saturday at 8:21 PM
Funny because we got a message from a staff saying the issue has been escalated.
Funny how now you are not insulting anymore not playing evil ….
What a wrong you scared mister racist ?


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 8:26 PM
I understood that calling you dicks, which I still think you are :slightly_smiling_face: , will not trigger in you any form of self-reflection and I have not nor will go any further than saying you've been acting like dicks :slightly_smiling_face:
No I'm just trying to understand what compels you so much to reply to me despite the suffering you say it causes you and I've come to think about whether you might just be socially awkward and don't know how to say to people that you appreciate them for taking time to stick with you.
Is that what's happening ? (edited) 


Manel
  Saturday at 11:09 PM
@ Joenn
I stand up for what’s right (very proud of that) BUT I never expected you to understand that, given how clearly limited you are.
That constant urge you have to respond? It’s the same thing you tried to project onto others. But let’s be honest, you’re the one carrying the weight of unresolved trauma. Maybe it’s an absent father, maybe it’s a mother who couldn’t show love. Either way, you’ve let it define you. Now your life is so empty, so devoid of purpose, that the only way you feel seen is by trying to belittle others.
But at the end of the day, no matter how loud you get, the truth stays the same: you are unloved, you are bitter, and you are alone.
We all have a choice:
 To be decent or despicable.
And you made yours, Mr. Racist.
Échec et mat


Joenn
:zrtw:  Saturday at 11:11 PM
You just keep coming back do you ? :smile:
11:12
You also keep speaking french which is against the rule of #help btw :zrtw:
